canvas-igp
==========

This is an HTML5 Canvas port of the "Irregular Grid Painter" (IGP) application by Zlosk.  You can find the original IGP here http://www.zlosk.com/pgmg/igp/downloads.html.  Zlosk has (quite reasonably) requested that any derivatives of his work call themselves something other than simply "IGP" to avoid confusion.

If you would like to easily run a local instance, run the following python command in the canvas-igp root directory (replace [port] with your desired port number):

python -m SimpleHTTPServer [port]

Then point your web browser at http://localhost:[port]

Alternately you can access the latest version on my website at http://andrewganim.com/canvas-igp
